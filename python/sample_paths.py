"""Resolve the input ROOT files of a sample.

A sample's files live under a single production root, which is site-local and
therefore an environment variable rather than repository content:

    $SKNANO_INPUT_ROOT/<era>/<dataset>/.../*.root

Only the part below that root is sample metadata, and for almost every sample
it is already implied by fields the JSON carries anyway -- ``PD`` for MC, the
data-taking period for DATA. So the common case needs no path field at all:

    {"name": "TTto2L2Nu", "isMC": 1, "PD": "TTto2L2Nu_TuneCP5_...", "xsec": 762.1}

Two escape hatches remain, in precedence order:

``path_glob``
    A glob relative to the input root, or absolute if it starts with "/".
    Use it when a production does not follow the layout -- a private
    reprocessing, a directory that has to be pinned to one CRAB submission.

``path``
    An explicit list of absolute files. Reproducible but unportable: it names
    one mount on one cluster and goes stale as soon as a production is
    extended. Kept for samples that genuinely need a hand-picked file list.
